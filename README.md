# Ensemble Learning Toolbox

This is a toolbox to enable the creation of custom ensembles in MATLAB.
It is possible to create a desired ensemble model using just a few lines of code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You just need MATLAB and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
This toolbox has been developed on MATLAB R2019a, but should also be compatible with earlier versions.

### Installing

Toolbox installation in MATLAB is rather simple.
You just need to add a copy of the source codes (src directory) in the MATLAB paths.

This can be made programatically with the following code:

```
addpath('<directory>/ELT/src')
```

Two simple demos can be found in the examples directory.
To run them, you just need to execute the scripts Demo_classification.m and Demo_regression.m.

## Built With

* MATLAB R2019a

## Contributing

## Versioning

We use a three codes versioning system: vA.B.C.
A stands for the major revision, and will be used when a major new feature is added or compatibility to previous major revision is lost.
B stands for minor revision, where new features will be added.
C is used for fixing bugs in the code.
